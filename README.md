## Overview

This README file provides information about the data and the computer code used to generate the results presented in Ardia and Sessinou (2024), **Robust Inference in Large Panels and Markovitz Portfolios**

By using the code, you agree to the following rules:

- You must cite the paper in working papers and published papers that use the code.
- You must place the DOI of this data/code repository in a footnote to help others find it.
- You assume all risk for the use of the code.

All datasets are proprietary. We do not have the rights to share any of the data. We provide pseudo data to illustrate the code usage. 

The computer code is written in R and allows for replicating all tables and figures presented in the paper.
